                                                          CHAPTER 1: Introduction To Aircraft
                                                          
I have been learning about how an aircraft works as part of my self-study.
these notes contain my understanding of basic aircraft concepts

An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by using air to produce lift.
Aircraft are used to transport people and goods through the air.
 Now lets see how does it work:

 When you are driving on a road or in the flying in the air there is always a gravitatonal force which pulls you towards the ground,to balance out that force the concept of wings was introduced in aircrafts.

 From there onwards there were some questions about what do we see in a aircraft?
 Then the term PERFORMANCE was introduced 
Q) What do we understand by the term PERFORMANCE ?
Lets take an example of motor bike
when we buy a motor bike we always look for 6 major things:
1)speed
2)fuel consumption
3)maneuver
4)acceleration
5)cost
6)maintaince

Now if we translate these things to airplane,
we would see that at what speed the aircraft fuel consumption is minimum and the time is which is also saved due to that speed 
the cost if the airplane
the maintainance
the conditions where it could fly through
the safety of that airplane
Vmax
Rate if climb


when we talk about fuel consumption we talk about the best speed(LIFT/DRAG ratio)
Some more main things we see is :
1) cruise speed
2) climb
3) maneuver
4) landing
