# Cockpit (Flight Deck) – Airbus A320

# What Is the Cockpit?
The cockpit, also called the **flight deck**, is the control center of the aircraft.

It is where pilots:
- control the aircraft
- monitor flight parameters
- manage navigation, engines, and systems
- communicate with air traffic control

Modern aircraft like the Airbus A320 use a **glass cockpit**, meaning most information is displayed on digital screens instead of analog gauges.

# Cockpit Layout Philosophy
The Airbus A320 cockpit is designed using a **pilot-centered and automation-focused philosophy**.

Key design goals include:
- reduced pilot workload
- clear presentation of critical information
- high level of system automation
- improved safety through warnings and protections

# Primary Flight Instruments

# Primary Flight Display (PFD)
The **Primary Flight Display** shows essential flight information, including:
- airspeed
- altitude
- attitude (artificial horizon)
- vertical speed

This display allows pilots to understand the aircraft’s flight condition at a single glance.

# Navigation Display (ND)
The **Navigation Display** provides:
- route information
- waypoints
- heading
- weather radar data
- terrain awareness

It helps pilots maintain situational awareness during all phases of flight.

# Engine and System Displays (ECAM)

# ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor)
The Airbus A320 uses the **ECAM system** to monitor aircraft systems.

It consists of:
- **Upper ECAM** – displays engine parameters and warnings
- **Lower ECAM** – displays system pages such as fuel, hydraulics, electrical, and flight controls

ECAM automatically alerts pilots and provides corrective actions during failures.

# Flight Control Interfaces

# Sidestick Controller
Instead of a traditional control column, the Airbus A320 uses a **sidestick**.

Functions:
- controls pitch and roll
- sends electronic signals to flight control computers
- works with fly-by-wire technology

# Rudder Pedals
Rudder pedals are used to:
- control yaw
- assist during crosswind landings
- steer the aircraft on the ground

# Thrust and Engine Controls

# Thrust Levers
The **thrust levers** control engine power.

On the A320:
- thrust settings are managed with detents
- autothrust works in combination with pilot input

# Engine Master Switches
These switches are used to:
- start engines
- shut down engines
- manage engine operation on the ground

# Aircraft System Panels

# Flight Control Unit (FCU)
The **FCU** is used to:
- set altitude
- set speed
- set heading
- control autopilot and autothrust modes

It acts as the main interface between pilots and the aircraft’s automation systems.

# Radio and Audio Panels
These panels allow pilots to:
- communicate with air traffic control
- manage navigation radios
- control cockpit audio levels

# Landing Gear and Brake Controls
The cockpit includes:
- landing gear lever
- brake controls
- parking brake

These systems are critical
